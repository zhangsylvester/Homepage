\section{Billey-Warrington Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
$C'_w$ is tight if and only if $w$ avoids $321$ and
	\[46718235,46781235,56718234,56781234.\]
\end{theorem}


\begin{definition}[Heap]
	Represent $s_i$ by 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[BJS]
	A permutation $w$ is $321$-avoiding if and only if no reduced word for $w$ contains consecutive subword $\cdots s_is_{i\pm 1}s_i\cdots$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	It's easy to see that, if a permutation contains $s_is_{i\pm 1}s_i$ as a subword, then it contains $321$. This proves one direction of the lemma.
	
	For the other direction, assume $w=\cdots c\cdots b\cdots a\cdots$ where $a<b<c$. Then use some wiring diagram argument.
\end{proof}
